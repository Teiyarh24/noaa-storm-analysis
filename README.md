# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 2

## Analysis of NOAA Storm Database

### Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database to identify:
1. Which types of events are most harmful to population health
2. Which types of events have the greatest economic consequences

### Files in This Repository
- `storm_analysis.Rmd` - R Markdown source file containing all code and analysis
- `storm_analysis.html` - Knitted HTML report (view this for the complete analysis)

### Data Source
The data comes from the [NOAA Storm Database](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2)

### How to Run This Analysis
1. Download the data file from the link above and place it in the same directory as the .Rmd file
2. Open `storm_analysis.Rmd` in RStudio
3. Install required packages: `install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2"))`
4. Click "Knit to HTML"

### Key Findings
- **Most harmful to population health**: Tornadoes
- **Greatest economic consequences**: Floods
